# Assignment

Write a Python function `merge_dicts` that takes in two dictionaries and returns a new dictionary that contains all key-value pairs from both dictionaries.
If a key appears in both dictionaries, the value from the second dictionary should be used.

```python
>>> merge_dicts({'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'b': 3, 'c': 4})
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```
