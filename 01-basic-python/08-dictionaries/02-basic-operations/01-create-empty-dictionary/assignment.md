# Assignment

Good news everyone: the `AssocList` you implemented in the previous exercise already exists.
It is such a useful data structure that Python has it built in.
It's not called an `AssocList`, however, but `dict`, which is, of course, short for dictionary.

You can find the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping).
Rely on it to solve this series of exercises.

## Task

Write a Python function `create_empty_dictionary()` which returns an empty dictionary.
